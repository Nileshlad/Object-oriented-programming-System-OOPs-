Inheritance:
The process by which one class acquires the properties and functionalities of another class is called inheritance. Inheritance provides the idea of reusability of code and each sub class defines only those features that are unique to it, rest of the features can be inherited from the parent class.

Inheritance is a process of defining a new class based on an existing class by extending its common data members and methods.
Inheritance allows us to reuse of code, it improves reusability in your java application.
The parent class is called the base class or super class. The child class that extends the base class is called the derived class or sub class or child class.
Note: The biggest advantage of Inheritance is that the code in base class need not be rewritten in the child class.
The variables and methods of the base class can be used in the child class as well.

Syntax: Inheritance in Java
To inherit a class we use extends keyword. Here class A is child class and class B is parent class.

class A extends B
{
}

**Terms used in Inheritance**
1.Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or
child class.

2.Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features.
It is also called a base class or a parent class.

3.Reusability: As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism which facilitates you to reuse the fields and methods of
the existing class when you create a new class. You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.

**Types of Inheritance:**
1.Single Inheritance: refers to a child and parent class relationship where a class extends the another class.

2.Multilevel inheritance: refers to a child and parent class relationship where a class extends the child class.
 For example class A extends class B and class B extends class C.

3.Hierarchical inheritance: refers to a child and parent class relationship where more than one classes extends
 the same class. For example, class B extends class A and class C extends class A.

4.Multiple Inheritance: refers to the concept of one class extending more than one classes,
which means a child class has two parent classes. Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance, read more about it here
